# TODO Lists

## pu@

- connect to api from client
  - client should not need to pass their connection id or the game engine id in their requests. api should be able to resolve that shit

## Should Really Do

- update linting/formatting rules for new structure
- add to readme info about structure
- add to readme info about building if needed to navigate code in vs code
- configure vs code to ignore quick open results from under /build or /dist or /lib

## Might Consider

- use [tsconfig inheritance](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#extends)
