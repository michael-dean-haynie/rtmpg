# TODO Lists

## pu@

- When player leaves a lobby, the board should disappear
- players should first enter their name it it should be in text hovering over their piece
- lobby area should only show when player is not in a game
- lobbies should have random name assigned or take player input upon creation
- player names should be shown in lobby section instead of uuids

## Should Really Do

- update linting/formatting rules for new structure
- add to readme info about structure
- add to readme info about building if needed to navigate code in vs code
- configure vs code to ignore quick open results from under /build or /dist or /lib

## Might Consider

- use [tsconfig inheritance](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#extends)
