# TODO Lists

## pu@

- start working on shared library for processing events against game state

## Should Really Do

- update linting/formatting rules for new structure
- add to readme info about structure
- add to readme info about building if needed to navigate code in vs code
- configure vs code to ignore quick open results from under /build or /dist or /lib

## Might Consider

- use [tsconfig inheritance](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#extends)
